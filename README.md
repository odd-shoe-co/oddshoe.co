# Odd Shoe Co.

Welcome to the official repository for Odd Shoe Co., a modern e-commerce platform dedicated to connecting people who need single shoes with the opposite shoe from the same pair. Our mission is to reduce waste, create savings, and build a community around a shared need.

## ‚ú® Mission & Vision

We believe that a single shoe shouldn't go to waste. Our platform serves two primary user groups:

1.  **Primary Purchasers:** Individuals who buy a new pair of shoes through our service. We ship them their needed shoe and hold the other in our inventory.
2.  **Secondary Purchasers:** Individuals who can purchase a single shoe at a discount from our curated inventory of available singles.

Our initial focus is on serving the needs of orthopedic patients, a large and underserved market, with a vision to expand to anyone in need of a single shoe. We are driven by sustainability, efficiency, and the power of community.
